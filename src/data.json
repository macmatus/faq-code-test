            "Hi Dan! Just wanna let you know how happy I am that I ordered my Ruroc Atlas Ronin from you guys. Set an alarm during the launch day to be sure I got the Ronin Limited edition and so happy I did! I was involved in an accident with my bike the otherday and the Ronin did it’s job way and beyond good.",

            "Well, just joined this page today after my buddy Patrick McGlothlen realized I was wearing a first gen Ruroc atlas core in my accident Sunday evening. I don’t personally remember anything from the incident at this time, but witnesses said they believe I had to be going 100 passing through a curve on a two lane road with a speed limit between 45 and 50.",

The day after that I got up without the doctor’s and tried to walk. (I succeeded). Amazingly only some brain bleeding, 3 fractured lumbars, and lung bruising/body bruising.  They let me go after me insisting on Tuesday afternoon.",
            "Thanks big time to Ruroc for making an amazing helmet. I’m bald so it’s incredible I don’t really even have any marks on my face or head after such a crash.  I fully stand behind this company and highly recommend them."

Due to this we had the rider, riding in the middle of our group. I was directly behind her.  When we were getting on the on ramp, she panicked a little and slowed down. Being right behind her I had to make sure a car wasn't going to hit us, I had limited time to react.",

As I did my head hit the ground, my shoulder, my hip and my left leg. When I finally got the chance I looked at my helmet thinking I would see gashes in the design, scratches all over. These pictures are the only damage. I felt my head bounce and what felt like scrapped on the ground and for this to be all amazing. The dents in the visor are so small I can't get my camera to capture them. It's an amazing helmet and I will continue to buy from ruroc for the foreseeable future. Thanks for all yall do!"

            "The first and lesser of the accidents happened May 27, 2020 on my way home from work. I was wearing the Atlas Ronin 1.0 which, to this day, is my favorite helmet. A lady merged onto my street and crossed over three lanes of traffic at once very rapidly. I was riding in the middle lane and didn’t have enough time to react as she crossed into my lane and I rear-ended her, causing me to fly over my handlebars and land hands first on the pavement. I slid a few feet on my head and finally ended up on my back with only a bruised finger to tell about. The bike was totaled and my helmet put up for display in my apartment.",
            "The second accident which I'm still recovering from occurred on September 23, 2020. Riding home from work again and this time wearing an Atlas Shuriken 2.0 when a driver turned left in front of me at an intersection and I T-boned his vehicle. I landed directly on my face and split my lip, most likely on the mechanism that opens and closes the front vent on the helmet and ended up with 3 stitches on my upper lip. My other injuries include a concussion with amnesia, lacerated kidney, partially collapsed lung, sprained ankle, and a number of cuts and bruises. The ruroc helmet definitely saved my life in this accident."

Well it could be worse I waited 2 and a half months without moaning had it for 4 days then was involved in a severe accident. I was knocked unconscious for 5 minutes as I landed directly on my head, but I walked out the hospital 6 hours later with just cuts, bruises, gravel rash and a broken collar bone. And that was all thanks to my helmet so yeah it yours might have some marks in the paint, but when in comes to it this lid will save your life as it did mine. So a massive shout out and thank you to Dan Rees and all the team at Ruroc for putting their all into such an amazing product that saved my life."

Before he could pass me and my friends who were ahead of me he started to come up on a parked car in his lane. Unfortunately rather than slow down (which he had ample room to even with poor brakes) he chose to swerve into my lane, immediately knocking me off my sportster sending me across the double yellow lines. My helmet hit another vehicle traveling the opposite direction before I hit the ground and ultimately came to a stop after rolling a bit. I was going the speed limit which was 35 at the time and I’m sure the vehicle I flew into was doing about the same. ",

Couldn't break anymore when I hit the grass next to the road, went face-first at about 50-60km/h straight into the ditch with about 30cm water in it. The bike turned 180 degrees and landed on top of me. The helmet filled up quickly with water, luckily I was able to get my head above the water on time. I got stuck with my left leg underneath the crash bars of the bike and wasn't able to lift it up myself. My phone flew off the quad lock mount, so I had to scream my way to help for about 5-10 minutes after a car stopped and helped me get the bike off my leg. I consider myself lucky to walk away from this accident with only a sore leg and a body full of bruises. It could've ended much worse if the water was a few centimeters higher or hit a tree that was right half a meter to the left. Everything was all-risk insured, so I should be good material-wise too. Checked the helmet but couldn't find any real damage nor a crack in the inner shell (it does stink a lot tho). Will send a request to Ruroc if it qualifies for the crash replacement that I bought with it. Stay safe out there guys",

            "Well my El Diablo almost assuredly saved my life last night. It was raining, very slick, went into a right hand turn and the back of my 2018 Roadglide Special started coming around, I was going very slow (about 10 mph) so I pretty much thought “well shit, but no big deal”. I was pivoting on the front tire and I had both feet down still going slow but seemed like it was building momentum. All of a sudden it caught traction and slammed me down highside. I ended up bouncing the side of my head off the curb which just so happened to be the gutter. Then my head hit the street and the top of the opening of the gutter was in my visor while my bike is still pushing me, trying to shove me into the gutter head first. Neck is hurt, back is hurt, shoulder is hurt, I have a pounding headache and hyper extended my right thumb but I’m pretty positive, even with as slow as I was going my Atlas saved my life. I’m pretty positive any decent helmet would have stood up to that impact but I usually don’t wear any of my other helmets, when I do wear a helmet, it’s my El Diablo that I grab."
