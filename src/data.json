            "The visor stayed on during the accident and it worked a treat. But I undid the right side to see the damage and it snapped inside now but held through. I must have gone a fair distance. Up to 100 meters or so.",
            "Overtaking a car and hitting the cat's eyes on the white line which sent me into a tank slapper due to being light on the front end for accelerating. Wheel never lifted off the ground. I do ride fairly aggressively but I don't ride like an arsehole. Just within my means and I waited to get round a wide corner to overtake on a long straight with no oncoming traffic.",
            "The bike landed on its left side, I went over the handlebars and had it knock me unconscious for a few seconds when it hit me in the  back of the head but when I came too I was still tumbling down the road."

            "Girlfriend and I were on our way home. We were on my DR650 dual sport. She was riding on the back while wearing the berserker ronin and I was wearing the shogun 2.0.",
            "What happened: Car didn't check his blindspot before changing  lanes and cut me off and we nearly collided with them. Unfortunately the roads were a bit slick at the time. We endup up high siding, from what the witnesses saw I flew off the bike head first into the pavement, sliding on my right side.",
            "The visor took most of the impact and luckily didn't break thanks to your guy's awesome R&D team! My girlfriend fortunately didn't take too much of a tumble since she landed on her back and onto the backpack which was luckily filled with clothes we just bought. The berserker did although take a few scratches onto its side.",
            "Needless to say the helmets most definitely saved us from anything too major and can't thank you enough for creating a helmet that isn't just amazing to look at but also life saving! FOREVER a Ruroc wearer."

            "I had the ruroc atlas 2.0 nerve decay, awesome helmet in both styling and design. It was absolutely perfect, until the day a van pulled out on me on a roundabout.",
            "I have no idea how you guys made such a well structured brain cage, as my helmet was the first thing that hit the van and the 2nd thing that hit the road.",
            "I black out for a few seconds following the van face plant, if the bike wasn't in a few pieces I would have thought I just slipped and went on my merry way. Helmet kept its shape perfectly, only a few scuffs and lost the plastic trim on the rear.",
            "I was so impressed with ruroc that I not only bought a berserker on release, but I have convinced even more people to get these. They love the designs, just needed a real incident with them and they got it (at my expense).",
            "Awesome job that everyone has done, can't wait for the future designs and products (my finger is ready to add them to the basket)"

            "My accident was a low speed turn. We were leaving a friend's memorial when we came across another rider who had run off the road. Due to this we had the rider, riding in the middle of our group. I was directly behind her.  When we were getting on the on ramp, she panicked a little and slowed down. Being right behind her I had to make sure a car wasn't going to hit us, I had limited time to react.",
            "Trying to go around her so that I wouldn't hit her or dump my brakes, I turned my forks too far and immediately knew I was going to have the bike fall. As I did my head hit the ground, my shoulder, my hip and my left leg. When I finally got the chance I looked at my helmet thinking I would see gashes in the design, scratches all over. These pictures are the only damage. I felt my head bounce and what felt like scrapped on the ground and for this to be all amazing. The dents in the visor are so small I can't get my camera to capture them. It's an amazing helmet and I will continue to buy from ruroc for the foreseeable future. Thanks for all yall do!"

            "Reaching out to tell you about the two accidents I've had while wearing ruroc helmets and how they probably saved my life both times.",
            "The first and lesser of the accidents happened May 27, 2020 on my way home from work. I was wearing the Atlas Ronin 1.0 which, to this day, is my favorite helmet. A lady merged onto my street and crossed over three lanes of traffic at once very rapidly. I was riding in the middle lane and didnâ€™t have enough time to react as she crossed into my lane and I rear-ended her, causing me to fly over my handlebars and land hands first on the pavement. I slid a few feet on my head and finally ended up on my back with only a bruised finger to tell about. The bike was totaled and my helmet put up for display in my apartment.",
            "The second accident which I'm still recovering from occurred on September 23, 2020. Riding home from work again and this time wearing an Atlas Shuriken 2.0 when a driver turned left in front of me at an intersection and I T-boned his vehicle. I landed directly on my face and split my lip, most likely on the mechanism that opens and closes the front vent on the helmet and ended up with 3 stitches on my upper lip. My other injuries include a concussion with amnesia, lacerated kidney, partially collapsed lung, sprained ankle, and a number of cuts and bruises. The ruroc helmet definitely saved my life in this accident."

            "I've actually been in two accidents with a 1.0 AND a 2.0 atlas helmet ðŸ˜¬. 2020 brought me some bad luck but all is well now.",
            "My accident back in September is the one that resulted in the attached images. It was a Wednesday and on my way home from work, maybe 10 blocks from the safety of my apartment, someone decided to turn left in front me causing me to hit the front edge of their passenger side door with a considerable amount of force. It is my sincere belief that had it not been for my atlas 2.0, I would not be here today to tell this story.",
            "I hit my head with so much force that it caused permanent memory loss of the event and a few hours after, as well as minor cognitive issues and significant debilitating headaches. Despite the head trauma, I was told I was never actually unconscious which is quite the testament to the impact protection of your helmets. I'll never buy from another lid manufacturer while I ride because in two real word tests, it did its job with ease."

            "On Nov 14th 2020, my wife and I were involved in a motorcycle accident. We were stopped at a red light and proceeded when the light turned green. A car ran the red light and struck us on my motorcycle as we were turning left. The impact threw my wife and me from the motorcycle and we both sustained injuries. I suffered nine broken ribs and a broken collarbone that had to be repaired surgically. The whole accident was caught on video and at one point I was tumbling across the pavement with my head impacting the ground multiple times. I am convinced that my Ruroc helmet saved my life. I had no cuts or scrapes on my face or neck and no evidence of a concussion was discovered at the hospital. Ruroc, because of the excellent product that you have created I am still able to see my family and my wife every day. Thank you"
